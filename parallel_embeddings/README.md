- `used_Advantage_system4.1_easy_instance.txt` contains the disjoint embeddings that were used on `Advantage_system4.1`. These are not the complete 6 embeddings because of missing hardware. 
This is a list, whose elements contain a dictionary that maps the heavy-hex qubits to the Pegasus graph qubits

- `used_Advantage_system6.1_easy_instance.txt` shows the same thing, but for `Advantage_system6.1`
