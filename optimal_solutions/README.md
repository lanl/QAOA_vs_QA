# Optimal solutions

Computed using CPLEX. In the case of higher order terms, order reduction was first applied so that the resulting problem contains only linear and quadratic terms (with auxiliary variables)

Minimum and maximum energies are reported. Each text file is a list of the minimum, or maximum energies, where the index of the number in the list corresponds to the instance number in `problem_instances/`
